code works by executing main.m

variables should be altered inside main.m file, they are described with comments inside the code

works on MATLAB

can work in parallel or on a single core

solution of radiative transfer equation in spherical medium using Lorenz Mie theory

parallel plane rays are incident from air to sphere. 

the code estimates assymetry parameter of a large sphere 

while calculating the scattering direction the code uses cumulative inverse relation of exact single scattering pahse function or henyey greenstein function approximation depending on choice
